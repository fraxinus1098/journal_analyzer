# File path: journal_analyzer/core/processor.py
"""
Core processing logic for journal entries.

Original purpose: Core processing logic for journal entries
Current status: Most functionality is now in JournalAnalyzer and PatternDetector
However, it could be useful for:

Phase 2: Text preprocessing for training data
Future features: Additional text analysis metrics
Modular design: Separating text processing from pattern detection


Recommendation:
For now, we can consider these files optional since their core functionality is covered
Keep them as stubs for Phase 2 where we might need them for model training
If we don't end up using them in Phase 2, we can remove them to keep the codebase clean
