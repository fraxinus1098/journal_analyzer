# File path: journal_analyzer/core/extractor.py
"""
Extracts and structures content from journal entries, handling various input formats 
and ensuring consistent data structure.

IMPORTANT! Original purpose: Extract and structure content from journal entries, handle various input formats
Current status: Most of its functionality has been absorbed into the JournalAnalyzer class
However, it could still be valuable for:

Phase 2: Pre-processing data for model training
Future enhancements: Supporting additional journal formats
Separating concerns: Keeping extraction logic separate from analysi

Recommendation:

For now, we can consider these files optional since their core functionality is covered
Keep them as stubs for Phase 2 where we might need them for model training
If we don't end up using them in Phase 2, we can remove them to keep the codebase clean
